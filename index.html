    <p>
	Although I am just a twenty-one year old woman, I like to feel unique. This is reflected in my passion to travel and discover as many different cultures as possible. I would like to share with you my favorite trips which were New York, Abu Dhabi and Madrid.

   <div class="card-white">
 <h2>New York ðŸ—½</h2>
  <p>New York is a fantastic city located in the United States. I had the chance to go there several times to see some of my family who live there. The locals are very friendly and the city is huge.

   <div class="card-white">
 <h2>Abu Dhabi ðŸŒ´</h2>
  <p>Abu Dhabi immerses its visitors in a different world than what they are used to. It seems like an oasis out of the desert. Between sand, heat and palm trees, I was immediately charmed.

   <div class="card-white">
 <h2>Madrid ðŸŒ¹</h2>
  <p>Madrid looks like Paris in a caliente version. It is a city where I would like to live in the future because the inhabitants always seem to be happy and in a good mood. It is the city of good weather and parties.  </p>
